# koeken
A Linear Discriminant Analysis Effect Size (LEfSe) wrapper.  


### Installing Koeken
Because Koeken needs scripts found within the QIIME package, it is easiest to use when you are in a MacQIIME session. If you have MacQIIME installed, you ***must*** first initialize it before installing Koeken. If you do not have macqiime installed, you can still run koeken as long as you have the scripts available in your path. See http://qiime.org/install/install.html for more information.  
```shell
macqiime
```

Run the command below while in a ***MacQIIME*** session. The command will install new R packages. If you do not have R installed, please see https://cran.r-project.org/, and install the package first before running.  
```shell
pip install https://github.com/twbattaglia/koeken/zipball/master
koeken.py --help
```

### Simple Example
In this example we have a typical workflow using koeken. We have an otu-table in .biom format, a mapping text file, and an output folder to place the results. The ```--class``` parameter corresponds to the column name which describes the different groups in your mapping file. The ```--split``` parameter corresponds to the column name which describes the different timepoints in your data. ```--clade``` will produce the cladograms popular with LEfSe.

```bash
koeken.py \
--input otu_table.biom \
--output output_folder/ \
--map mapping_file.txt \
--class Treatment \
--split Day \
--clade
```

### Introduction
Koeken is a wrapper around QIIME and LEfSe to create a more convienient and easier workflow from a QIIME OTU table to biomarker microbial species. It was specifically developed for the experiments which have more than one time point and many groups. Koeken allows the user to specify the variable which correspond to the 'Time' of a users dataset to run LEfSe on each 'Time' factor. Additionally it has the capabilities to specify particular groups to compare to one another, without any additionally subsetting.

### Features
* Run LEfSe over many time points
* Specify groups (2+) to compare to eachother
* Automatically generate cladograms for each comparison.
* Clean GreenGenes naming conventions (e.g k__,g__)
* Find significant biomarker PICRUST Level 3 features.
* Combine the data from many timepoints into a 'heatmap-like' table. (See 'pretty_lefse.py -h' for more information)
* Modify thresholds for testing parameters (e.g effect size, p-value, strictness)
* Collapse OTU data on different levels [Default = L6(Genus)]

### Outputs
Koeken generates many intermediate files as it iterates over each time point. For each timepoint, koeken runs a QIIME command (summarize_taxa.py), LEfSe formatting and LEfSe significance tests, but each of the steps are separated into their respective folders to minimize confusion. A breakdown of the folders are shown below.

```
output_folder/  
|--summarize_taxa/ (Output from running QIIME commands)  
|--lefse_output/ (Root folder for storing LEfSe outputs)
|----format_lefse/ (Output from running LEfSe formatting command)
|----run_lefse/ (Output from running main LEfSe command)

```
### Using Output Files on Galaxy-LEfSe Application
If you want to use the galaxy version of LEfSe to generate figures, you can use the provided output from koeken. During file upload you must select ```lefse_res``` for the files in the 'run_lefse/' folder and must select ```lefse_for``` for the files in the 'format_lefse/'.
